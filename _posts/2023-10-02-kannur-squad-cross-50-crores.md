**Kannur Squad**, a Malayalam-language police procedural crime thriller film directed by Roby Varghese Raj and starring Mammootty, has been a box office hit, crossing 50 Crores within 8 days of its release.

The film is inspired by the real-life Kannur Squad, a police unit that was formed in 2007 to expedite case resolutions. The movie follows the story of Assistant Superintendent of Police George Martin (Mammootty) and his team of police officers as they investigate a dacoity and murder at a politician's house in Kasaragod. The team faces obstacles within and outside the system as they race against time to apprehend the culprits.

Mammootty delivers a stellar performance as the determined and dedicated George Martin. He is ably supported by a talented cast, including Rony David Raj, Azeez Nedumangad, and Shabareesh Varma.

The film is well-paced and keeps the audience engaged throughout. The action sequences are well-choreographed and the climax is particularly thrilling.
