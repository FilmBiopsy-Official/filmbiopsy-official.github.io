1917 is a emotional movie engraved in a war movie. Story is about army messangers cutting through front lines delivering military orders which is put through in a series of nerve wrecking action scenes. Sam Mendes has done an excellent home work both on the sets and behind the camera, because the power of some shots are superb. The way the movie has chosen to impart the story is quite good by mixing in series of true events into the story through which it has delivered emotional content. The movie is a excellent choice for the audience who are ardent followers of war movie. This movie is not having about full fledged war action movie. Personal opinion is those who has seen Saving Private Ryan will definitely love it and wouldnâ€™t miss it. 

  
Overall Rating : Good
