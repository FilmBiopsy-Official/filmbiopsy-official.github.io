BigBrother directed by Siddique starring Superstar Mohanlal made average opening in first 3 days at All India BoxOffice. Movie which opened to average reviews couldn&#8217;t find its target audience yet due to poor marketing by makers. Another Big Budget Action movie going down due to poor marketing strategy.
