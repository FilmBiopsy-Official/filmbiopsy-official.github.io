A below average opening for this half baked comedy thriller. Will need good promotion to gain Hit status.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Micro Review</span>

Brother&#8217;s Day is a nice movie with an equal blend of feel-good comedies in the first half & okay thriller in the second half. The screenplay is better compared to the other 2 movies. Kalabhavan Shajon as a director has done a very good jobüëçüëç. 

First half deals with some passable comedies which are just feel good, not over the top comedies. Towards second half movie races towards a decent thriller mode. Length of the movie & almost a predictable end pulls back the movie from being a Blockbuster ingredient. Good to Release this movie during Onam Vacation üëçüëçüëç
