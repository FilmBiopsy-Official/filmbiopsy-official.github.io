<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Mammootty has already impressed Telugu audience with his 2019 movie "Yatra" which was boxOffice hit and did total business of 50 Crores. He was hero in one of the All Time Classics in Tollywood "SwathiKiranam". Most of his Malayalam blockbusters are dubbed to Telugu and reportedly profitable for Telugu distributors.
