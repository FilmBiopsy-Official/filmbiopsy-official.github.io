**Kannur Squad** is a popular Malayalam police thriller movie directed by Roby Varghese Raj and featuring the renowned actor Mammootty. This film has made a significant mark at the box office by grossing over 80 crores globally.

The movie draws its inspiration from a real-life police unit, the Kannur Squad, established in 2007 to solve cases swiftly. It revolves around the story of Assistant Superintendent of Police, George Martin (played by Mammootty), and his team of officers. They are on a mission to investigate a robbery and murder that occurred at a politician's residence in Kasaragod. Their journey is filled with challenges both from within and outside the police system as they rush against time to catch the culprits.

Mammootty's performance as George Martin is outstanding, portraying a determined and dedicated police officer. He is well-supported by a talented cast, including Rony David Raj, Azeez Nedumangad, and Shabareesh Varma.

The film maintains an engaging pace that keeps the audience hooked. The action scenes are expertly choreographed, and the climax is particularly exciting. This crime thriller is definitely worth a watch!
