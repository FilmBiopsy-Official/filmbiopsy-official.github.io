**Railway Guard** is an upcoming Malayalam movie starring Prithwiraj Sukumaran. This movie reveals the untold miseries of Railway Guards. This film is written by Unni R and directed by Deepu Karunakaran.

**2nd September 2019**

Prithviraj & Deepu Karunakaran joining hands after Tejabai & Family. This time they are joining together for a much serious experiment subject. Let&#8217;s hope for a variety movie from the team. Only successful movies in Deepu Karunakaran&#8217;s career were Crazy Gopalan & Fireman, while Karikunnam 6&#8217;s & Tejabai and family, winter bombed. If enough budget is provided, Deepu has that talent to showcase his various ideas.
