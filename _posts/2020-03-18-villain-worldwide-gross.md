Villain directed by B Unnikrishnan starring Mohanlal was made on Budget of 22 Crores. Movie opened to mixed reviews. Mohanlal & Manju Warrier has done a splendid job by enacting some of the toughest scenes. Movie didn&#8217;t go well with mass audience, hence end up as flop in Worldwide Theatricals.
