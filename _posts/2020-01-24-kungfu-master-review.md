Abrid Shine&#8217;s Kungfu Master is a really good attempt as a martial art movie in Malayalam. Storyline is not exactly fresh but excellent fight choreography,exotic locations centred around Uttarakhand, decent performances from the lead actors (lady lead Neeta Pillai and main antagonist Sanoop being the showstealers), exhilarating BGM all combine to make this tale of vengeance a different and entertaining viewing experience.
