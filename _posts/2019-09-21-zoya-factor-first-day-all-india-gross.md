Zoya Factor starring Dulquer Salmaan & Sonam Kapoor has taken a disastrous opening all over India on Day 1. 90 % of screens were almost washout. Movie has been rejected by film goers on Day 1 itself it seems. Movie which got decent reviews may pickup in Day 2 & Day 3.

It seems like, Dulquer Salmaan&#8217;s quest to make it big in Bollywood is still a distant dream after Karwaan and Zoya Factor not performing big. Hope he will concentrate more on South Indian industries like Malayalam & Tamil where he is widely accepted as young superstar. In Kerala, Dulquer Salmaan is king of Opening. _Kurruppu_ is his upcoming project in Malayalam while _Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal_ is his Next Tamil Release on cards.
