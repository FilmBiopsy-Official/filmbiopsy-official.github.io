**Mammootty** started the decade 2010 with 3 Blockbusters (PokkiriRaja, BestActor, Pranchiyettan & TheSaint) but lost that success mantra in next 2 years with none of movie getting superhit in (2011-2012). He came back with feel good movie Immanuel. He then have to wait till 2015 to get a Blockbuster in BhaskerTheRascal. Eventhough movies like Varsham,RajadhiRaja were superhits, he lost that dominance which he possessed during previous decade(2000-2010) where he delivered 2 industrial hits (Rajamanikyam & PazhassiRaja).

In 2017, he entered his first 50 Crore movie with Blockbuster movie Greatfather. Since then every year he delivered Blockbuster with Abrahaminte Santhathikal (2018) & MadhuraRaja (2019). In year 2019, he tasted 100% success rate with all his movies entering hit status. He entered coveted 100 Crore club in 2019 with MadhuraRaja. He even became first Malayalam actor to have 2 movies entering 100 Crore club in single calendar year (MadhuraRaja & Mamangam).

As an actor, he was unmatchable by any other Malayalam actor in this decade. His counterpart Mohanlal faded away as an actor and started concentrating on BoxOffice numbers and he is successful as a Superstar now like Salman khan & Vijay. 

With classics like Pathemaari, Munnariyippu,Peranbu & KuttiShrank in this decade Mammootty showed actor in him is still intact & want to explore into more layers of acting. He even delivered a Superhit in Realistic genre with Unda. 

As an actor he went extramile this decade and proved that why he is still Megastar,the MegaActor.
