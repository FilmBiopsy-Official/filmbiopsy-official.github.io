>  
> Are&nbsp;BOOKMYSHOW Collections a well planned Promotional Figures??? 

  
After Some of the producers raised the concern of credibility of BookMyShow rating recently, We thought of Analyzing&nbsp;the Collections posted by the Online Booking App. On analyzing we observed that the collections posted by the site is not in same level.

  
Let see few of our analysis.

A) Lucifer v/s Anjaam Pathira.

Even though Both the Movies are Blockbusters&nbsp;in Mollywood&nbsp;we found that the collection reported by BookMyShow having huge variation when compared to the Votes. Lucifer&nbsp;bms gross is reported as 39 Crores while AnjaamPathira bms gross is reported as 19 Crores.

If we compare the both, Mohanlal starer Lucifer having more votes than Anjaam pathira. There are possibility that fans might have voted multiple times as Mohanlal having Good fanbase compared to Kunchacko Boban. By considering the fact, Lucifer might have collected close to 20 Cr Only if we go as per the votes.  
Either AnjaamPathira is deflated by 19 Cr or Lucifer is Inflated by 19 Cr.

  
B) Lets Comapare Odiyan V/s Anjaam pathira

<img loading="lazy" width="720" height="238" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1_IMG-20200312-WA0021.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1621" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1_IMG-20200312-WA0021.jpg 720w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1_IMG-20200312-WA0021-300x99.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" />  

Even though Odiyan having less votes than Anjaam pathira the collection reported is 1 Cr more. Again the fan-based duplication of votes considered, Odiyan will have around 25 k votes lesser than Anjam pathira.Hence either Odiyan is Inflated by 5 Cr or Anjaam Pathira is deflated by 5 Cr.

  
C) Lets Compare Big M recent collection as per BMS.

Please refer the Chart below:-

Ittymaani and Mamangam as per BMS having same votes but collection 3 Cr more for Ittymaani. MadhuraRaja and Shylock is way ahead in terms of votes when compared with Ittymaani but Collection wise is less. How???

<div>
  The average rate per vote of Mohanlal films is around Rs 3134 per votes against Mammootty Films Rs 2012.
