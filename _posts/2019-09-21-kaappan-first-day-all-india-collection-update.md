Movie has made an Average Opening despite being an Action movie. Despite having presence of Malayalam Superstar Mohanlal, movie made an average opening from Kerala also. Movie which opened to positive response is supposed to cross 40 Crores in 3 days. 25 Crore is the BreakEven amount in Tamilnaadu. Kerala rights have been grabbed by Tomichan Mulakupaadam for 3 Crores. Telugu states opening is too low. Surya who had good market value in Telugu states is finding it hard to retain it due to consecutive flops. Hope Kaappan will help him for a deserving comeback in BoxOffice.
