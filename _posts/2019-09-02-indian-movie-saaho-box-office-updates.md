**_Saaho_**&nbsp;(meaning May the victory yours) is an Indian action thriller film written and directed by Sujeeth. The total budget for this film is 294 Crore. The film was initially released on 29th August 2019.

Despite the negative comments raising from various corners, Saaho is making a good initial collection.

**4th Day update**

Saaho 4 days Worldwide Gross crossed 350+ Crores 👏👏👏👏. From today it&#8217;s huge drop worldwide and is a bad sign for the movie which needs to make above 600+ Crore for BreakEven. In North India & Telugu states, the movie is gonna earn Hit status. But Tamil Nadu, Karnataka & Kerala it is a disaster for the distribution team. Kerala rights were sold for 6 Crore & 4 days Kerala Gross is 2.8 Crores. If the movie gets a decent run in North India & Telugu states, chances of BreakEven is possible 🤞
